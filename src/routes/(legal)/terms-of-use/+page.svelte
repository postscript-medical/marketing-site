<h2>
  The Platform
</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    You agree and accept that the Platform is hosted online by PostScript Medical and its infrastructure providers. We shall use commercially reasonable endeavours to make the Platform available 24 hours a day, seven days a week, except for routine and emergency maintenance. However, access to the Platform is not guaranteed. We will not be liable if the Platform or any content on it is unavailable at any time for any reason. From time to time, we may restrict access to some parts of the Platform at our sole discretion.
  </li>

  <li>
    PostScript Medical reserves the right to upgrade, maintain, tune, backup, amend, add or remove features, redesign, improve or otherwise alter the Platform at its sole discretion. PostScript Medical shall not be responsible for any loss of data stored on the Platform whatsoever.

<h2>
  Payment of fees
</h2>

<ol>

    From time to time, PostScript Medical may provide different tiers of access to the Platform, with different fees due for each tier, and with different levels of functionality and content available on each tier.

    Unless otherwise notified to you by PostScript Medical, access to the Platform is provided on a periodic subscription basis. For institutional subscribers, that is a 12 month period. For individual subscribers, that is a 1 month period.
